linux-modules
=============

example linux device driver modules I developed around 2006.
They were developed for an embedded system that had a 2.6 kernel. The CAN bus drivers were developed before the Linux kernel had built-in CAN bus support so a custom driver was required. The Multicomm serial driver did not have a compatible driver in the kernel so I developed on for it also.
